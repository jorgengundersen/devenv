# Agent Guidelines

- If a problem or bug occur; review the issue and suggest professional fixes
- If you changed or created a bash script, run `shellcheck`
- We have no backwards compatibility requirements, as long as the specs and plans are followed.
- Do GAP analysis as part of research when asked to create a research document.
- Use checkmarks when creating plans
